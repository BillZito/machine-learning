    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

The simple example is linear--when there is a clear separation between data that is in the group and out of the group, a linear line can divide the classification of the two sets. By drawing this line, SVM's can take something very complicated such as image classification and effectively determine if something should be 'in' or 'out.' \n",

SVM is trained by drawing a line between a sample data set given a kernel function. The simple kernel function is linear, but more complicated kernel functions allow for parabolic and more complex lines to be drawn to separate data. Then, this same line is applied to tehe test set. Given each data pint, the SVM gives a binary in/out rating. It is effective for complex classification problems, but can be slow with large data sets and also ineffective with lots of features compared to datapoints. "

    "### Implementation: Model Tuning\n",
    "Fine tune the chosen model. Use grid search (`GridSearchCV`) with at least one important parameter tuned with at least 3 different values. You will need to use the entire training set for this. In the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    "- Create the F<sub>1</sub> scoring function using `make_scorer` and store it in `f1_scorer`.\n",
    " - Set the `pos_label` parameter to the correct value!\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using `f1_scorer` as the scoring method, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_obj`."
